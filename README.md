# Plant Seedling image classification

This project aims to explore the performance of dif-ferent CNN models in plant seedling image clas-sification. 
The dataset that used in this researchcontains approximately 960 unit plants belongingto 12 species at several growth stages. 
The CNN models applied in this project includes ALexNet,VGG and GoogLeNet. 
We compare the test ac-curacy of each CNN models in our dataset and the conclusion is GoogLeNet has the best performance with 92 % test accuracy.  
We also ap-ply normalization methods like gray scaling andchannel standardization to preprocess the images.
However, no significant improvements are detected with these two approaches
